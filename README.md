* Change the title
* Click on the icon to change the icon

  * The custom section is the user's own icon, so if you want to use a custom icon, you can download an SVG file and place it in the `Workspace/data/emojis/` directory.
  * It is recommended to download emoji plugins in the market to replace the native expressions, otherwise the formatting here will look bad.

> Note: A newly created item can be set as a "Group", and once set as a group, it cannot be changed later.

If you create a new item under a group, this item will be assigned to that group by default.

## Acknowledgement

- This plugin is heavily inspired by aTimeLogger, of which I am a paid user. However, I'm not accustomed to recording activities on my phone, so I created this plugin version called Time Logger.
